NVIDIA market sentiment

         1. Positive Sentiment from AI Boom (2023): NVIDIA became a key beneficiary of the global AI surge, driven by the success of tools like ChatGPT. The company's GPUs became essential for training large language models and other AI applications, resulting in an 84% surge in its stock price during the first quarter of 2023. This added $300 billion to its market capitalization, making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 during this period.

         2. Resilience Amid Market Challenges (2022): Despite challenges like declining PC demand, NVIDIA maintained strong market sentiment due to its dominance in data center and gaming GPU markets. While desktop GPU shipments saw a decline, NVIDIA still commanded 80.2% of the discrete GPU market share, showcasing its market strength.

         3. Product Releases and Market Optimism (2023): New product launches, including the RTX 4060 and 4070 series GPUs, fueled optimism. These products targeted the midrange gaming segment, historically a popular choice among consumers, contributing to revenue growth.

         4. Strategic Partnerships: Partnerships with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Oracle further solidified NVIDIA's position in AI and cloud computing, enhancing investor confidence.

         5. Mixed Sentiment in Early 2022: Earlier in 2022, sentiment was more tempered due to macroeconomic pressures like rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. However, NVIDIA's long-term growth prospects in AI and gaming helped mitigate negative impacts.

This means that NVIDIA market sentiment started off bearish and has then remained bullish up to now.
